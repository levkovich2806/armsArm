General
- Never leave unused or commented out code, delete it immediately
- Never add code in advance which might be useful in future or might potentially be useful
- Always write comments in TypeScript code in Russian language (both "//" and "/*" comments)
- Never add console.log or console.warn statements unless explicitly requested
- After generation is finished, recheck that there are no unused exports or imports present in the files you change
- Never keep code marked as @deprecated, immediately refactor usages and delete @deprecated code
- When creating new types, interfaces, functions or classes first search the code if exactly matching identifier exists, reuse it

Coding style
- Use indentation of 2 spaces
- Use dangling comma
- Do not use "export default"
- Do not create index files
