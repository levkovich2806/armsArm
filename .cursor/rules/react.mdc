React
- Do not inline styles into React JSX unless urgently necessary
- Never use FC type
- Do not use useMemo, useCallback, React.memo unless absolutely necessary, we are using React compiler for that
- If there are more than 30 lines of non-JSX code in a component, try to extract related code as hooks to simplify the component
- If new hooks are added, recheck that they are not called conditionally
- Common reusable components are in `src/components/common` folder
- Before implementing a new component, check if it is not already implemented in `src/components/common`
